# Weather web app

## The website is available:

https://cintia-sari.github.io/WeatherWebApp/

## Why I wrote this website:

I wanted to write an application that could be useful for everyone, of which there are few, and with which I could show that I also understand API calls. This is how I chose the weather web application.

## funkcionalit√°s:
you can ask for the weather data of almost all cities and villages in the world.

You will find these data:
* current temperature
* show the sky
* daily minimum - maximum
*daily hourly breakdown
* weather data for the next 10 days

Instead, the application has 22 different wallpapers and icons, so that the user has the best possible experience.
## I used this pages:

* API : https://www.visualcrossing.com/
* icons: https://www.flaticon.com/
* pictures:
